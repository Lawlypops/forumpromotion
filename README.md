# Forum Promotion: Virtual Cash Extension #

Forum Promotion is an extension for phpBB 3.1 that adds a "virtual cash" system to the board. Users can earn points for posting, donate cash to one another, and spend that cash using supported extensions.

Forum Promotion is currently in an *ALPHA* state. Using this on a live board is discouraged, and you would likely encounter bugs. If, however, you do make this mistake, please report the bugs you find to us. :) 

Forum Promotion is a creation of the [lawlypops] Development Team, which accepts applications from [anyone] [recruitment].
